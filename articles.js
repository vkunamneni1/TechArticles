    title: "How Netflix works: the (hugely simplified) complex stuff that happens every time you hit Play",
    description: "What isn't as simple is what goes into running Netflix, a service that streams around 250 million hours of video per day to around 98 million paying subscribers in 190 countries.

    description: `If you're just getting into web development, chances are you think you know how the web works - at least on a basic level. ...But then you try to explain how a basic website works and draw a blank.

    description: "It happens about once or twice a year. I travel over to my mother's house for a visit and, about two or three hours in, she says something like 'Hey, can you take a look at my computer? I just want to make sure everything is okay with it. You know I don't know what I'm doing.' She's right. She doesn't know what she's doing. She wants to, though.",

    title: "Learning To Code By Writing Code Poems",
    description: `Back in 2008, I started studying design and clearly remember how the sheer sight of code just intimidated me. I had some coding classes, and without any prior coding experience, I had a tough time understanding the code I first got in touch with.

    description: "As we all know by now, the web is flooded with information. It has tons (and tons) of websites, information, content, video, images, ect, that makes us really happy to look at. Now, if you think about it for just a moment, there needs to be some type of order behind the scenes, so when users type in a keyword (or several keywords), they will receive precise results (thus, leading them to feel super satisfied). Correct? Correct!",
